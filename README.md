If you check your project's structure, you will see that there is already an existing directory named test.  
Inside this directory, there are two directories, unit and e2e. For now, we should go to the unit folder.  
Here, you will see another directory called specs. This is where all our unit test specifications will reside.  
Let's start by creating a directory called __vuex__ inside specs. Here is where all our specs for Vuex-related JavaScript files will live.
